# Interact

## Getting Started

To install run the following command in the Julia REPL:
```{.julia execute="false"}
Pkg.add("Interact")
```
To start using it in an IJulia notebook, include it:
```{.julia execute="false"}
using Interact
```

## Example notebooks

The best way to learn to use the interactive widgets is to try out the example notebooks in the doc/notebooks/ directory. Start up IJulia from doc/notebooks/:

```{.shell execute="false"}
ipython notebook --profile julia
```
Interact has been tested with IJulia on IPython 2.1.0+
