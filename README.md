# Interact

## Getting Started

Install:
```{.julia execute="false"}
Pkg.clone("git://github.com/shashi/Interact.jl.git")
```
Include:
```{.julia execute="false"}
using Interact
```

## Example notebooks

The best way to learn to use the interactive widgets is to try out the example notebooks in the doc/notebooks/ directory. Start up IJulia from doc/notebooks/:

```{.shell execute="false"}
ipython notebook --profile julia
```

A full API documentation is in the works.

Interact has been tested with IJulia on IPython 2.1.0+
